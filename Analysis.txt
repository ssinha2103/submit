for Task 0 = analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of my solution == O(n) as normal for loops are working



for Task 1 = analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of my solution == O(n) as normal for loops are working

for Task 2 = analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of my solution == O(n) as normal for loops are working



for Task 3 = analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of my solution == O(n log n) as it has sort operation


for Task 4 = analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of my solution == O(n log n) as it has sort operation.
